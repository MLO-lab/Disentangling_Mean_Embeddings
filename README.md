# Disentangling Cosine Similarity of Mean Embeddings

This is the code that accompanies the paper ["Disentangling Mean Embeddings for Better Diagnostics of Image Generators"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01314), published at IAI Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024.

We propose a novel approach to disentangle the cosine similarity of mean embeddings into the product of cosine similarities for individual pixel clusters via central kernel alignment.
This allows quantifying the contribution of the cluster-wise performance to the overall image generation performance.
